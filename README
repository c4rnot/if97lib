# Welcome to the if97lib steam tables library #
Introduction
============================
if97lib is an open source implimentation of the Revised Release on the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam, which van be found here:
http://www.iapws.org/relguide/IF97-Rev.html

if97lib is written in plain C, with multithreadding support via OpenMP and is released under the BOOST licence.

if97lib IS NOT YET COMPLETE


Obtaining the latest version
============================

if97 is hosted on bitbucket using the Mercurial revision management system.

The bitbucket page for this project is here:
https://C4rnot@bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib


In order to get the latest version of the source (assuming you have Mercurial already installed):
* hg clone https://C4rnot@bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib


Alternatively, download a zip of the source from here:
https://bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib/downloads



Compiling
=========
### Compiling Automatically ###

if97 uses the Waf make system. This needs Python 2.5 or higher to be installed.  
See the file "wscript" for installation instructions for Waf and configuration of the if97 build.

To compile and build simply run:
* waf config
* waf


Waf will look for a suitable compiler eg. gcc, msvcrt.   On windows, I use MinGW.  Make sure that the path environment variable is set up to point to it.

Further (rather bewildering) information on how to use Waf is available here:
https://code.google.com/p/waf/




### Compiling Manually ###

A number of files use the C math library <math.h>.  -lm needs to be passed to the compiler to link this correctly.

Some code uses OpenMP for multithreading.  Since openMP uses pragma calls to the preprocessor, the code will compile and run correctly, even if your compiler doesn't support OpenMP

use the  -fopenmp flag to enable multithreaded calculation in gcc.  Please consult http://openmp.org for instructions for other compilers.


The example below compiles and links common.c, IF97_Region2.c, IF97_Region2_met.c, region2_test.c to produce the executable region2test_lnx

* gcc -fopenmp IF97_common.c IF97_Region2.c IF97_Region2_met.c region2_test.c -o region2test_lnx -lm




Testing
=======

Units are made to test each of the regions according to the checks proposed in IAPWS-IF97 based on the test tables provided in IAPES-IF97.

It is reccomended to check the output of these.

Contributing to the if97lib code base
=====================================
If you wish to contribute to if97lib, please contact the administrator at martins_abyss@hotmail.com 
in order to arrange for permissions to be able to "push" changes back to the Bitbucket repository.

Mercurial is used for revision management, therefore you will need to have Mercurial installed.

On a debian based installation
* sudo apt-get install mercurial

On windows it can be downloaded along with a nice GUI from
* http://tortoisehg.bitbucket.org/



### Using Mercurial and Bitbucket ###

to download the source:
* hg clone https://C4rnot@bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib
 
If you add a file to the sources, in order to add it to the mercurial archive 
* hg add <filename>
 
To commit (i.e. to make a snapshot of the state of the code, along with a note)
* hg commit -m"<description of the commit>"
 
To upload the commits back to the bitbucket archive:
you will need to be recorded on bitbucket as a contributer to the project 
Please contact martins_abyss@hotmail.com if you wish to contribute.
* hg push

To pull updates from elsewhere that have been uploaded to bitbucket
* hg pull
* hg update

### Commenting the Code ###

Documentation for if97lib is auto-generated from code comments using Doxygen

These comments need to be in a particular form to be picked up by Doxygen.  
(In Geany comments which turn blue are picked up by Doxygen)

A Tutorial is given here:
http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/docblocks.html


The configuration file is "if97-doxy-config", and assuming you have Doxygen installed, to generate the documentation
* doxygen if97-doxy-config

The resulting documentation is located in the doc/ directory
