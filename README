# Welcome to the if97 library #


Obtaining the latest version
============================

if97 is hosted on bitbucket using the Mercurial revision management system.

The bitbucket page for this project is here:
https://C4rnot@bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib


In order to get the latest version of the source (assuming you have Mercurial already installed):

$ hg clone https://C4rnot@bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib


Alternatively, download a zip of the source from here:
https://bitbucket.org/C4rnot/if97lib/downloads





Compiling
=========

The Make system has not yet been implimented.

A number of files use the C math library <math.h>.  -lm needs to be passed to the compiler to link this correctly.

Some code uses OpenMP for multithreading.  Since openMP uses pragma calls to the preprocessor, the code will compile and run correctly, even if your compiler doesn't support OpenMP

use the  -fopenmp flag to enable multithreaded calculation in gcc.  Please consult http://openmp.org for instructions for other compilers.

The example below compiles and links constants.c, IF97_Region2.c, IF97_Region2_met.c, region2_test.c to produce the executable region2test_lnx

$ gcc -fopenmp IF97_constants.c IF97_Region2.c IF97_Region2_met.c region2_test.c -o region2test_lnx -lm









Testing
=======

Units are made to test each of the regions according to the checks proposed inIAPWS-IF97.

It is reccomended to check the output of these.



References
==========

This library is based on the International Association for the Properties of Water and Steam Revised Release of the IAPWS Industrial Formulation 1997 for the Thermodynamic Properties of Water and Steam, which is available here:
